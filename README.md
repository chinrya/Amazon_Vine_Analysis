# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to learn and utilize big data in order to go through large datasets and extract any information we need. We learned AWS and Google Colab in order to iterate through our dataset of over 1 million unique rows for this challenge. 

## Results

Once all our coding has been done for this project, we were able to see that there were only 94 vine reviews, in comparison to the 40471 non-vine reviews. Once we dive even deeper and look at 5 star reviews, these numbers shrink even more, with only 48 vine reviews having 5 stars, while non-vine reviews had 15663 5 star ratings. This is actually very interesting as it shows the paid reviews have a higher percentage of 5 star ratings, which we can see with about 51% of vine ratings having 5 stars, while non-paid reviews only had a 39% 5 star rating. 

## Summary

After reviewing all the aformentioned information, I do believe that vine ratings are biased, with a 12% increase of 5 star ratings, though the smaller sample size can skew things when being compared to the much larger number of unpaid reviews. An additional test to prove this could be to throw all this information into R Studio, and find the summary statistics to determine correlation or causation between paid and unpaid reveiws and 5 star results.
